There once was a dog, his name was Rover.
The dog was very nice, but the dog was also lonely.
So he went on a journey to make some new friends.

First the dog met a parrot, but the parrot kept repeating the dog and the dog didn't like that, so he kept on walking.

Then the dog met the elephant, but the elephant was way to big, so the dog kept on walking.

Then the dog met another dog, and they became best friends. 

The end.
